#Workflow of the Backend

The SurveySense AI backend constitutes the entire secure, centralized architecture of the project, built using Node.js/Express and utilizing MongoDB for flexible data storage. This robust foundation is now functionally complete and fully verified to support both the administrative Web Dashboard and the field-level Mobile Application. The security model is strictly enforced by JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which are required for authentication on all protected routes and are used to carry the user's roleâ€”either supervisor or enumerator. The user lifecycle is handled through the /auth/register endpoint, which securely manages two modes: it permits the one-time, initial setup of the Supervisor (the high-authority system manager) and then exclusively allows for Enumerator self-registration, mandating a govId field for accountability and scalable onboarding.

The core functionality revolves around two sets of mission-critical routes. The Survey Management routes, prefixed with /surveys, are primarily accessed by the Supervisor's Web App: the Supervisor uses POST /surveys to save the complex questionnaire forms, including all necessary adaptive logic and validation rules, directly into the database. These forms are then retrieved via GET /surveys/:id by the Mobile App before the enumerator goes offline. The second critical set, the Data Synchronization routes, prefixed with /responses, handle the incoming data flow: the Mobile App utilizes the POST /responses endpoint to upload collected answers and vital paradata (including GPS coordinates, time taken per question, and device information) when back online. This synchronization step is a massive gain over paper-based systems. Finally, the Monitoring function is served by GET /responses/:surveyId, which is securely restricted to the Supervisor role, allowing management to view and analyze all collected field data on the dashboard for quality assurance and fraud detection. This complete structure guarantees data integrity, role separation, and reliability, fulfilling the foundational requirements for the MoSPI digital transformation.
